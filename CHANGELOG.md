# Changelog

For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/sumup/Android-MerchantSDK/blob/master/README.md)
## Version 5.0.4
* [FIXED] The SDK does not enforce landscape screen orientation on the Signature screen, similar to the rest of the payment flow.

## Version 5.0.3
* [ADDED] Introduces "configureRetryPolicy()" in the payment builder to configure the retry policy when the result of a transaction can not be retrieved at the end of a transaction. (see dedicated section in README [here](https://github.com/sumup/sumup-android-sdk#retry-policy-configuration) for more)
    * Both `pollingInterval` and `maxWaitingTime` should be provided in milliseconds.
    * If `disableBackButton` is set to true, the Android device's back button will be disabled while the retry screen is shown.
    * If `maxWaitingTime` elapses without a response, `SumUpAPI.ResultCode.ERROR_UNKNOWN_TRANSACTION_STATUS` will be returned.
    * If `disableBackButton` is set to false, pressing the back button while the retry screen is displayed will also return `SumUpAPI.ResultCode.ERROR_UNKNOWN_TRANSACTION_STATUS`.
    * If `pollingInterval` is greater than `maxWaitingTime`, the value of `maxWaitingTime` will be adjusted to match `pollingInterval`.
    * If either `pollingInterval` or `maxWaitingTime` is passed as a negative value, it will default to 0.
    * If `configureRetryPolicy()` is not called, the SDK will default to returning the `SumUpAPI.ResultCode.ERROR_TRANSACTION_FAILED` error code, and default values will be used while trying to get the status of the transaction.
    * Default values are 2000 ms for the `pollingInterval` and 60000 ms for the `maxWaitingTime`.

## Version 5.0.2
* [FIXED] An issue where successful transactions were returned without all the relevant information in the SumUpAPI.Response.TX_INFO object, e.g. the card type
* [FIXED] A bug where initiating a checkout while the Card Reader payment method was disabled in the merchant settings resulted in a transaction failure. The SDK now enables it intrinsically
* [KNOWN BEHAVIOR]
    * Declined/failed transactions may sometimes not return the card data (only) - SumUpAPI.Response.TX_INFO will still be populated with all the remaining metadata. This would depend on the exact moment any connectivity issue happened, that is whether card data from the reader was sent to the back-end or not.

## Version 5.0.1
* [FIXED] "duplicate class" issue (due to R8 obfuscation) possibly happening when integrating with other external libraries

## Version 5.0.0
* [ADDED] Support for the Solo Lite card reader (beta phase)
* [ADDED] Support for Australian Dollar and Mexican Pesos currencies - `SumUpPayment.Currency.AUD`, `SumUpPayment.Currency.MXN`

## Version 4.3.0
* [REMOVED] Dropping support for Android 7 (API 25) and below 
* [ADDED] Solo USB under Beta: the Solo card reader now supports connecting and transacting over USB cable. The minimum required Solo software version that supports the USB mode is 3.3.17.2.
  * If this version (3.3.17.2) is not yet available on your Solo when connected via Bluetooth, you can switch it to standalone mode (Menu-> Connection -> WiFi), login directly on the Solo and update it to the latest version. 
  * Solo USB is under beta phase which means that the feature still requires some optimization to ensure full stability.
  * Known limitation: currently, if the USB cable is unplugged, the USB permission on the mobile device will need to be regranted.
  * As of now, Solo is not able to wake up automatically from sleep mode. A connection needs to be reestablished from the Card Reader page.
